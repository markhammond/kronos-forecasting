# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Joint forecasting with known-future covariates

- `TimesFmForecaster.ForecastJoint` takes several series at once (up to 32), attends over
  them jointly, and lets any of them carry values known into the future. Series are
  normalised per variate, so mixing a price in the thousands with a flag in {0,1} needs no
  scaling. There is no variate identity or ordering — the model sees anonymous series and
  infers their relationship from co-movement in the supplied window.
- A variate marked known-future is by construction not a forecast target; marking the
  target is refused, since that would hand a series its own future.
- The known future is gathered by rolling whole patches forward, so the context must be a
  positive multiple of the patch length and leave at least one patch after it. Both are
  now validated rather than producing a silently wrong anchor.
- The variate ceiling is read from the checkpoint rather than hardcoded: it sits in the
  same config block as the layer and head counts, so another checkpoint may declare a
  different figure. `TimesFmForecaster.MaxVariates` reports what the loaded one states.
- `samples/GroceryCovariates` reproduces the scenario from Google's covariates notebook —
  ice cream and sunscreen, with temperature and promotion known for both weeks. Its
  numbers are NOT comparable: the notebook uses the XReg path, which regresses covariates
  on forecast residuals, whereas 3.0 attends over them as variates.

### Packaging

Only `Tsfm.Forecasting.TimesFm` changed. The other four are republished at the same
version because a project reference packs an exact-version dependency, so TimesFm 0.1.3
requires a core 0.1.3 to resolve against.

### Testing

- `Tsfm.Forecasting.TimesFm.IntegrationTests` covers the joint API, including that
  changing a known-future variate actually moves the forecast, and that identical input
  does not. These are **local only**: the TimesFM checkpoint is ~1.2 GB and
  non-commercially licensed, so CI never fetches it and the tests pass vacuously there.
  CI runs them regardless, which proves they compile and start.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-09-02

Names two things that were previously literals a caller had to know.

- `KronosForecaster.Channels` replaces the bare `6` at every call site, and carries the
  row-major layout, the channel order and the amount derivation in its own documentation.
- `ICheckpoint.MaxContext` states the longest context a checkpoint can attend over: 2048
  for Kronos-mini, 512 for Kronos-small and -base. It varies by checkpoint, so it is not
  a constant of the architecture.
- `Infer` now refuses a context beyond that limit. Upstream truncates silently, which
  reads as a working call that quietly ignored the bars beyond the ceiling.
- The sample takes its context from the checkpoint rather than a hard-coded number, and
  selects its device through `DeviceType` rather than a string.

No change to inference; the ports remain parity-verified.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-02

### Projected paths

- `KronosForecaster.InferPath` writes the projected OHLCVA as `rows x horizon x 6`,
  sized by `PathLength`. The decode always produced all six channels; only the close
  was surfaced.
- Rollouts are reduced per channel per step by a caller-supplied `RolloutAggregator`
  (`ReadOnlySpan<float> -> float`), which is the shape the reference uses internally
  (`np.mean(preds, axis=1)`). `Mean` is the default, matching it; `Median`,
  `AtQuantile` and `Rollout` are provided. Samples are ordered by rollout index.
- Paths are frequently not well-formed candles, and this is the model rather than the
  port: channels decode independently with nothing tying `high` to `close`. A single
  rollout broke ordering in roughly 30% to 70% of candles depending on the checkpoint,
  smaller ones being worse; averaging across rollouts reduces that severalfold, cancelling
  the noise rather than enforcing anything.
  The reference does no post-processing either, and its headline example runs
  `sample_count=1`. Clamp if you need valid candles.

### Documentation reaches consumers

- `GenerateDocumentationFile` was never set, so 0.1.0 shipped no `.xml` and gave
  consumers no IntelliSense beyond signatures. All five packages now carry it.
- `Infer` documents every parameter, including which channels are filled rather than
  ignored — the model reads six and has no mask, and the reference derives amount as
  `volume * mean(open, high, low, close)`.
- Both forecasters record that inference is not thread safe.

### Allocation and API shape

- Per-window scratch is rented once and passed in pre-sliced rather than allocated per
  window, and the per-batch `ToArray()` in the sampler is gone.
- **Breaking:** `WriteStamp` takes `Span<float>` rather than `float[]`. Source-compatible
  for array callers, binary-breaking against 0.1.0.

The Kronos and TimesFM inference paths are otherwise unchanged and still parity-verified.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-30

First release of the family.

Supersedes `Kronos.Forecasting` 0.1.0, which was published under the previous name and
is deprecated in favour of `Tsfm.Forecasting.Kronos`. The Kronos code is unchanged; only
the package identity and namespace moved.

### Tsfm.Forecasting (MIT)

- `Safetensors` reader — checkpoints load without Python at build or run time
- `ICheckpoint`: weights as streams, from embedded resources or a directory

### Tsfm.Forecasting.Kronos (MIT)

- Kronos tokenizer (encode and decode) and autoregressive model, ported to TorchSharp
- `Tsfm.Forecasting.Kronos.Weights.Small` and `.Mini`, checkpoints embedded at pinned
  revisions
- Verified stage by stage against the reference on CPU and Metal

### Tsfm.Forecasting.TimesFm (Apache-2.0)

- TimesFM 3.0 inference: patch embedding, the mixing transformer stack (sequence
  attention, variate attention, feed-forward), quantile head, and the surrounding
  preprocessing — cumulative running statistics, RevIN, future-covariate rolling
- OHLCVA supplied as variates; one forward pass yields 64 steps at nine quantiles
- Verified stage by stage against the reference on CPU and Metal
- **No weights, and none can be published.** The checkpoints are non-commercial; see
  README and NOTICE

Licences differ per package because the ports derive from differently licensed sources.
Neural modules are deliberately not shared between the two adapters: RmsNorm, RoPE and
attention differ in exactly the details that parity checking exposed, and unifying them
would put a verified port at risk to save little.

Known limitations, all deliberate and documented in the README: neither model has a
key-value cache, so attention is recomputed per decode step to preserve checkable
parity; results are not bit-identical across devices; and Kronos's sampling stream
diverges from its reference in order to be batch-invariant, which the reference is not.
